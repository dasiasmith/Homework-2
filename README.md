Portfolio

## About

This web application demonstrates my first draft of my professional portfolio that will be builded on as the course progreses. This portfolio showcases current skills to potential
employers with the hopes of eventually adding links to deployable web applications. The portfolio can be found at the following link: https://dasiasmith.github.io/Portfolio-1/

This portofolio utilizes html, CSS, javascript, flexbox, and media queries to showcase a recent photo, my bio, work samples, resume, and contact information. 


The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
