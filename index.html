                    Welcome to my page! My name is Dasia and I began my career journey wanting to become a graphic designer.
                    While in high school, I was told if I put "engineer" at the end of my career I would make a lot of money.
                    I'm sure they meant to say Industrial Design but somehow I resurected out of college with an Environmental Engineering
                    degree. I quickly realized that construction and hydraulic design is not for me so I enrolled in a full-stack
                    bootcamp with hopes to trade all that in for coding and website desgin.
